        <h2>What is your long term goal and or career pathway?</h2>
			<p class="c2-p">I want to spend 2-3 years in Front End Development or mobile.
				- I basically want to spend 2-3 years programming to build my skills and self-confidence.
				- FED attracts me the most because I want to be able to see something tangible from my efforts and I am intrinsically motivated by design issues. 
				- But actually it is my craft I want to develop. So I'd rather work in a good backend team than a FED team with poor craft
			- From there I'll decide to either go further up the Tech ladder, or swap over to Team Lead.
			- I'm pretty scared of it, but longest-term, I'd like to run a small Eng dept, whether that's my own startup or not, I'd like to have some shares in it one way or another.
		</p>
			<h2>What skills (non-technical - human skills) would you like to see developed in yourself while at EDA?</h2>
			<p class="c2-p">Emotional Intelligence skills.
				- When I'm feeling vulnerable in some way, I get self-critical. This can impact my work, my relationship with colleagues etc.
				- I want to develop thinking patterns to recognise and neutralise the self-critic.
				- And I'd like a second _nice-to-have_ set of skills like walking into a room and instead of feeling anxious, wish everyone happiness.
			- Time Management skills
				- I've had good chats with my facilitator already about these issues.
					- Tech topics/activities are an infinite well. I want to develop skills to go as deep as I need to and no further.
					- I love the metaphor of committing meaningful work small-and-often and I want to apply it to how I manage my time.
						- Break work down to the smallest meaningful, actionable pieces.
						- Do those to get regular sense of satisfaction.
						- Commit regularly so I know where I'm up to and don't need to keep state in my head. Plus I can look back and see where I've been so my Remembering self doesn't become too critical.
						- With small pieces of work and regular commits, it is easy to share where I got up to with my teammates.

<h2>A description of your own strengths and limitations</h2>
#### Limitations
- My ego. I can be afraid to look bad i.e. asking for help, submitting work I subjectively think is poor.
- Overly emotionally invested in work. Sometimes I can't just walk away from a project that isn't done. I can borrow too heavily from my energy/happiness and I'll end up paying for it later with a low mood/tiredness.
<br><br>#### Strengths 
- I enjoy collaborating and helping others to succeed.
- I'm interested in a wide range of topics in the Bootcamp.
- I have a good eye for visual design
- I'd rather do something small and complete it than the opposite, when working in teams.
- I'm constrained by commitments to family so am disciplined
<h2>Based on the above description, a commitment to how you will manage your workload in this programme. This should include - an explanation of how you will manage yourself to work productively and sustainably with other learners, facilitators and industry/community representatives.</h2>
To paraphrase; what will I do to make sure I can be the best 'me' at all times?

My instinct is to just go hard during all hours available to me. Get food and sleep where I can like a marching army.

But that's not going to work for me or my family and I don't want to establish such self-sacrificing habits. In fact I want to develop work habits that are self-sustaining.

To be my best, I need;
- exercise: 2-3 runs per week, perhaps a gym visit.
- time with family: both to help run the household but also to keep our relationships strong. 
- time for myself: make time to do things I enjoy

I'll publish a schedule of work time v non-work time and revisit it weekly.
<h2>A commitment as to how and where you will seek help in a timely way.</h2>
1. Reach out to the team if I'm stuck beyond 30 mins on a problem
2. Ask for facilitator's help if I'm still stuck an hour later.

For non-technical (i.e. personal issues) I will bias towards talking to my facilitator as early as I can.
<h2>A description of what you expect from the facilitation team</h2>
Weekly catch ups: These are going well. I'll come with topics to discuss or else just talk stream-of-consciousness. I'd like F to share aphorisms about what they're seeing of my experience.

If  the F notices I'm not doing well or could be doing better in some area, I'd rather know sooner than later.
<h2>Any scheduling information such as block-out times when you are committed to other things. For example, you might have whanau commitments such as school drop-offs. Itâ€™s important to plan these in.</h2>
