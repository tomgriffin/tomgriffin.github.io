        <h2>3 New things I've learned about myself and my ego.</h2>
        <article>
          <p>
            These learnings align with Growth Mindset/Fixed Mindset. The first two issues indicate Fixed Mindset thinking.
          </p>
          <p>
            <ol>
              <li>I am afraid to be wrong/look like I don't know what I'm doing. Especially in front of large groups. Foundations is a large group and I don't know anyone well yet. I found it hard to post updates about my completed work esp if I wasn't happy with the work. I was rarely happy with my work because I was timeboxing and not getting it to a state I am more comfortable sharing. Intellectually, I can reason about why it's a good idea to share work even if I'm not 100% happy with it. But in my heart, there was often some resistance there so I didn't do it at every opportunity.</li>
              <li>At times, my expectations for my own ability to solve problems quickly are too high. I can then get too quickly frustrated and subequently self-critical when I don't solve something quickly. I noticed this in Sprint 5 challenges e.g. Minesweeper and JS Carnival.</li>
              <li>I learned I can mitigate these tendancies by focussing on my process and what I'm learning in each moment, rather than on whether I get the solution right quickly/first time.</li>
            </ol>

        <h2>What are the role of values, empathy and self awareness in learning and programming?</h2>
        <article>
          <p>
            Honestly, I'm not sure about the importance of values in learning and programming. I don't think this is an issue for me personally. 
          </p>
          <p>
            Empathy is an important framing for all aspects of learning and programming. It's a challenging and difficult journey. It is important to realise that everyone will have different challenges and struggles at different times. But also that it is possible to get through most difficult situations with time and effort.
          </p>
          <p>
            Self-awareness and self-acceptance are very important. You need to learn to know and monitor yourself. It can be too easy to ignore your own feelings and try to push through. This borrowing-from-yourself won't work well in the long term.
          </p>
          <p>
            For me, Growth Mindset + Neural Plasticity as well as EQ are 2 concepts which have really resonated with me as I've learned about them in Foundations.

        <h2>What has surprised me the most about the core learning?</h2>
        <article>
          <p>
            <ol>
              <li>What it is like to Think Like a Web Developer and that you can develop and apply your own process to solving any/all problems.</li>
              <li>How NP and GM are both sides of the same coin. Your brain is always changing and you can quickly and significantly improve your ability in any area through regular practice. Since NP happens regardless of what we do, we can make the most of NP through a Growth Mindset, which is the cognitive equivalent of that physical process. Whereas a fixed mindset is unhelpful as a mindset when you encounter challenges. Plus it doesn't reflect biological realities about how the brain functions.</li>
              <li>EQ is actually more important for long term career enjoyment and success than IQ. And that EQ skills can be learned; </li>

        <h2>What were the most challenging aspects of the core learning?</h2>
        <article>
          <p>
            Extracting the meaning and steps to improve, that work for me, and that I can actually use to drive the changes I want.

        <h2>Why does DevAcademy spend so much time focusing on core learning in a web development bootcamp course?</h2>
        <article>
          <p>
            Reading the materials and from my own experience, a strong set of Core skills will help you be happy and successful and deal with adversity as a Developer. Beyond a certain point, everyone has technical skills and they matter less in the overall picture of success.
          </p>
        </article>
        <h2>Is time spent studying core learning a waste of time? Should we have all done more programming practice instead? </h2>
        <article>
          <p>
            Absolutely not. In fact we could spend more time on them in my opinion. Being aware of Core skills, their importance, and spending time improving them, will actually help you develop technical skills throughout your life because you'll understand how to learn, the importance of practice, working with others, how you work best, how to help yourself when you're struggling.
