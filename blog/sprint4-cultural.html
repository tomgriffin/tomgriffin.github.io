        <h1>Neuroplasticity and ... </h1>
        <h2>How understanding the principles of neuroplasticity benefits people.</h2>
        <article>
          <p>
            Understanding these principles of neuroplasticity (NP) helps people becasue it gives them a mental model for how the brain grows and changes. They can take this understanding and figure out which of their behaviours contribute or don't contribute to NP and brain growth.

              <strong>Use it or lose it.</strong>
              <br><br>Failure to drive specific brain functions can lead to loss of abilities.
            </p>  
            <p>
              <strong>Use it and improve it.</strong>
              <br><br>Training that drives a specific brain function can lead to improving abilities.
            </p>
            <p>
              <strong>Specificity.</strong>
              <br><br>The nature of the training experience dictates the nature of the change in the brain (plasticity).
            </p> 
            <p>
              <strong>Transference</strong>
              <br><br>Change in function as a result of one training experience can even lead to learning other similar skills.
            </p>
            <p>
              <strong>Interference</strong>
              <br><br>Brain changes (plasticity) that result in bad habits can interfere with learning good habits.
            </p>
            <p>
              <strong>Repetition matters.</strong>
              <br><br>Change (plasticity) requires sufficient repetition.
            </p>
            <p>
              <strong>Intensity matters.</strong>
              <br><br>Change (plasticity) requires intensive training.
            </p>
            <p>
              <strong>Time matters.</strong>
              <br><br>Different forms of change (plasticity) in the brain happen at different times during training.
            </p>
            <p>
              <strong>Salience matters.</strong>
              <br><br>The training experience must be meaningful to the person in order to cause change (plasticity).
            </p>
            <p>
              <strong>Age matters.</strong>
              <br><br>Training-induced change (plasticity) occurs more readily in younger brains.
            </p>
          </div>
          <p> 
            <br>Armed with this knowledge, people can make changes to their behaviour to leverage the principles of NP to make the best conditions for brain growth and ultimately fulfilling their potential.

        <h2>How to engage with the principles of neuroplasticity for your own benefit.</h2>
        <article>
          <p>Naturally I'm thinking of how to apply the NP ideas to the Bootcamp.
            <br><br>I will endeavour to do good, challenging, regular practice of skills I have - to keep them strong - and skills I want to develop.
            These include skills in the Tech and Core parts of the curriculum.</p>

        <h2>How to increase your neuroplasticity.</h2>
        <article>
          <p>
            Get younger :)
            <br><br>Good regular practice like Kata for coding. I'm not sure how to regularly practice some of the Core skills.
            I suspect we'll do that in the Bootcamp to extend what we've learned in foundations.

            In addition to the course materials, I found <a href="https://www.cfimove.org/10-principles-of-neuroplasticity-part-1/" a>this</a> list of NP principles useful.
