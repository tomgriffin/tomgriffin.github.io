            I needed to create a blog. It felt like a really big job and I didn't know where to start. I decided to <span style="text-decoration: line-through">copy as much as I could</span> take inspiration from a magazine that was beside me on the couch at home.

At first I thought - sweet, a couple of colours on each page and the rest of the design looks quite simple.

            Earlier that day, I'd gone through the Udacity course <span style="font-style:italic">Intro to HTML and css</span>. In <span style="font-style: italic"> 20. Code, Test, Refine</span>, they suggest a process for building web pages. 
            
            I really liked that big-to-small flow and I decided I'd follow it to build the main page of the blog.

            <ol>
                <li>Look for natural boxes</li>
                <li>Look for repeated styles & semantic elements</li>
                <li>Write your HTML</li>
                <li>Apply styles (from BIGGEST to smallest)</li>
                <li>Fix things</li>
            </ol>


Unfortunately, they didn't say how to add styles ... especially whether to use id's or classes.
<br><br>
So I sketched out a basic design using paper and pencil and started following the big-to-small flow.
<br><br>
Once I finally got to the fun part - styling my pages like the magazine, I was really, really eager to get stuck in. I had my html page and added my title, navigation links, and some text about me. I quickly wanted to get the css going so I could start styling.
<br><br>
To style the blog's title <span style="font-style: italic;">T.Here</span>, the quickest thing I could think of was to give the &lt;div&gt; and &lt;h1&gt; elements each an id so I could put the id in the css file and start associating styles to it.

I didn't have the patience to think about what classes I'd need - because I didn't know how the actual design would look.

            <ul>
                <li>
                    Id's uniquely identify an element on a page. You can’t/shouldn’t have two elements with the same id.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Classes classify one or more elements in the same way. So … you kind of need to know what those classifications are first.
                </li>
            </ul>
        </p>

            It took about an hour of finding colours, fonts, changing font size, aligning to the centre and fiddling with the padding before I was happy enough.
            <br><br>So should I have used Classes rather than id's? Let’s compare the two and think about the trade offs in using one or the other.
        </p>
        <table>
            <tr>
              <th>Comparison point</th>
              <th>ID's</th>
              <th>Classes</th>
              <th>Creating my first blog page</th>
              <th>Maintaining & collaborating on the blog in the future</th>
            </tr>
            <tr>
              <td>Syntax</td>
              <td>html: &lt;h1 id=&quot;hero-title&quot;&gt; <br>
                css: #hero-title {}
                </td>
              <td>html: &lt;h1 class=&quot;hero-title&quot;&gt; <br>
                css: .hero-title {}</td>
              <td>Syntax differences are trivial</td>
              <td>Syntax differences are trivial</td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
              <td>Scope</td>
              <td>Identify a single element and need to be unique</td>
              <td>Classify a group of elements</td>
              <td>I was working on styling one element at a time. So ID’s were great because any changes would only affect the element with that ID.

                <br><br>But if I wanted to style 2 or 3 elements in the same way e.g. items in the top nav, I’d need to repeat the style for each element
                </td>
              <td>It’ll be too hard to keep ID’s unique going forward.

                <br><br>I’ll definitely want to style elements in common groups and classes are the best way to do this. Apply the style to the class and all elements in the class will get updated.
                </td>
            </tr>
          </table> 
        <p>In the end, I think ID’s were fine for an initial hack-together of a design on a single page. For any other purpose, classes will be better.</p>
