        <h2>3 New things I've learned about myself and my ego.</h2>
        <article>
          <p>
            These learnings align with Growth Mindset/Fixed Mindset. The first two issues indicate Fixed Mindset thinking.
          </p>
          <p>
            <ol>
              <li>I am afraid to be wrong/look like I don't know what I'm doing. Especially in front of large groups. Foundations is a large group and I don't know anyone well yet. I found it hard to post updates about my completed work esp if I wasn't happy with the work. I was rarely happy with my work because I was timeboxing and not getting it to a state I am more comfortable sharing. Intellectually, I can reason about why it's a good idea to share work even if I'm not 100% happy with it. But in my heart, there was often some resistance there so I didn't do it at every opportunity.</li>
              <li>At times, my expectations for my own ability to solve problems quickly are too high. I can then get too quickly frustrated and subequently self-critical when I don't solve something quickly. I noticed this in Sprint 5 challenges e.g. Minesweeper and JS Carnival.</li>
              <li>I learned I can mitigate these tendancies by focussing on my process and what I'm learning in each moment, rather than on whether I get the solution right quickly/first time.</li>
