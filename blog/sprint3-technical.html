            <h2>JavaScript and its relationship to HTML and CSS.</h2>
            <p class="article-body-text">
                Seeing how JS interacts with html and css has opened up a whole new paradigm of understanding about the web for me. 

                Most things you want to do as a user of a website, have JS woven in and around them. 
                
                An analogy to a house;
                HTML is the structure and definition of the website, like the framing of the house defines its structure and different rooms.
                CSS styles and positions what users see on the page. This is like the interior and exterior style of the house.
                JS is needed to capture and respond to user interaction. Stretching the house analogy a bit ... you would need Javascript to take a shower, cool a meal, watch netflix, weed the garden, paint a wall.
            </p>
            <h2>Control flow and loops.</h2>
            <p class="article-body-text">
                Control flows are how decisions are made in code. Typically decisions are done at a simple-enough level where the result can be true or false.
                e.g. if the checkbox about receiving marketing material is checked, email the material to the customer. If it isn't, don't email them.

                When these small decisions need to be made about more than one or two items, loops come in very handy. They are especially useful where you don't know how many items you have.
                You can use a loop to check your entire customer database, identify those who want marketing emails, and send them another one.
            </p>
            <h2>The DOM and how to interact with it.</h2>
            <p class="article-body-text">
                The DOM doesn't fit into the earlier house analogy :(.

                The DOM is an object representation of the site's html and css, that JS can use to reach through and change the site's html and css in the browser.
            </p>
            <h2>Object data access | difference | Array data access.</h2>
            <p class="article-body-text">
                Data in arrays can only be accessed by using the index of each item in the array. An index is like a seat number in a stadium. You can only access whoever or whatever is in the seat, using the seat number.

                Data in objects can be access by any of the properties of the object. In our stadium example, we can acces or identify a person using anything we know about them e.g. their first name, height, t-shirt colour etc.
            </p>
            <h2>Functions and why they are useful.</h2>
            <p class="article-body-text">
                Functions are a great way to put useful pieces of code into a single place. The benefits of this are firstly, that they can be used by other parts of the code base without having to be written from scratch.
                Secondly, if you find you need to make a change due a mistake or new information, you can change the function once and all places in the codebase that use the funciton will get the benefit of your change.
