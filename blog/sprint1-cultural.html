          <article>
          <h2>Explain a situation where you have had an ethical decision to make. Discuss how you weighed up the values involved in that decision, the decision you made and the consequences of the action you took.</h2>
            <p class="c2-p">I don't know.</p> 
          <h2>Describe how your culture has influenced your values and identity.</h2>
            <p class="c2-p">I'm not sure what my culture is. With Canadian and NZ parents, and a NZ-Chinese wife, having lived overseas in a few places, but back in NZ for 13 years, I don't think there's a culture that I'm part of. I feel more like I'm trying to piece something together that's unique to me. I don't think there's a group of people out there who share much in common with me. I tend to think my values and identity are influenced by more immediate factors e.g. personality, family, being a parent, career choices.</p> 
          <h2>Evaluate your strengths and limitations in terms of your learning and career development.</h2>
            <p class="c2-p">#### Strengths</p>
                <ol>
                    <li>Motivated: I try to do the best I can</li>
                    <li>I love helping others and collaborating</li>
                    <li>I'm interested in a wide range of topics</li>
                </ol>
            <p class="c2-p">#### Limitations</p>
                <ol>
                    <li>When I'm feeling unsure/vulnerable, I'll tend towards perfectionism.</li>
                    <li>And also self-criticism</li>
                    <li>When I'm stressed, I also sacrifice self-care. I borrow against myself and inevitably have to pay that back afterwards in terms of a long rest/quiet time/time alone.</li>
                    <li>Planning skills/techniques need improvement</li>
                </ol>
            <p class="c2-p">#### Personality type

            <h2>Identify which of your strengths might help you in your learning journey and how they might intersect with learning obstacles.</h2>
            <p class="c2-p">I assume this means which of my strengths might also be an obstacle if not managed/ mitigated?
                <br><br> I'd say tending towards perfectionism - this will help me do work to a high (subjective) standard, but if taken too far, may limit my progress in what is a broad, rather than deep EDA course.</p>
