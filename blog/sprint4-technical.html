        <h1>How to solve a problem in my career.</h1>
        <h2>This one time, at Free Code Camp, I got blocked on a simple problem.</h2>
        <article>
          <p>
            <strong>What was the problem?</strong>
            <br><br>I was trying to solve a fairly complex challenge where students and their test scorces needed to be added to a Gradebook. 
          </p>
          <p>
            <strong>What problem solving techniques did I use?</strong>
            <br><br>Immediately I assumed the issue was with the syntax I was using to access the different types of data - say the test score for a particular person. 
            This stuff is called dot-notation and bracket-notation and ever since the Foundations Sprints started ~3 weeks ago, I've struggled with which of these to use and when.
            <br><br>So as I say, I immediately assumed the problem was with this syntax so I tried renaming variables and objects, Googling dot and bracket notation, 
            I tried all the different combo's of dot-notation and bracket-notation, I Googled the compiler error I was getting. I was console.logging everything.
          </p>
          <p>
            <strong>How did you feel throughout the process?</strong>
            <br><br>My negative thoughts increased with my frustration as each of my problem solving solutions failed. Here are my actual notes at the time.
            <br><br><i>I feel stink like right now when I'm stuck on a complier error. I feel like I'm stupid and I'm frustrated with object notation. I have the tightness in my chest and I feel like hammering through to solve this no matter what. And that if I'm struggling here, I'll be no good in an actual job. And I get afraid of feeling negative. A sort of negative inception.</i>
          </p>
          <p>
            <strong>What did I learn?</strong>
            <br><br>In the end, all my syntax here was fine. I'd actually typo'ed a word somewhere else in my code.
            <br><br>The lesson I took away was to look for simple solutions first rather than assuming the problem is massive and hard. With this approach, it is quick to either fix or rule out the simple things, then you can move on to other potential solutions. On the other hand, if you assume it is a hard problem, you might waste a lot of time digging in that area, when actually it's a simple quick fix.

        <h2>Elegance? ... uhhh ... I dunno.</h2>
        <article>
          <p>
            I don't feel like I've solved any problems in an elegant way so far. I look at some of the suggested solutions in repl.it for the Kata and I think those are elegant. 
            <br><br>But what does elegant actually mean wrt to solving problems? 
            <br><br>Does it mean writing really concise code?
            <br>Does it mean that initially the reader goes 'huh?' and then they go 'Ohhhhhh, wow that's awesome! 
            <br>Or does it mean the reader doesn't even notice the code and can just concentrate on getting their task/job done?
          </p>
        </article>
        <h2>Reflect on how confident you feel using the problem solving techniques and process.</h2>
        <article>
          <p>
            <strong>Pseudocode.</strong>
            <br><br>I don't tend to use this much. I think I mix pseudocode up with comments and in fact I could make more use of pseudocode as a way of crystallising and sharing my thoughts
          </p>
          <p>
            <strong>Trying something.</strong>
            <br><br>I do this a lot without hesitation. In fact I might be more effective if I do this a little less, take some time to sit back reflect on what I've done so far and what I plan to do. This will make it easier to communicate with others about my thoughts and progress.<br>
          </p>
          <p>
            <strong>Rubber ducky method.</strong>
            <br><br>I haven't used it. 
          </p>
          <p>
            <strong>Reading error messages.</strong>
            <br><br>I do this if they appear, but they aren't always particularly helpful at the moment, with my current level of knowledge.
          </p>
          <p>
            <strong>Console.logging</strong>
            <br><br>I really find this useful and would like to improve my skills 
          </p>
          <p>
            <strong>Googling.</strong>
            <br><br>Very useful.
          </p>
          <p>
            <strong>Asking your peers for help, Asking coaches for help.</strong>
            <br><br>	I notice in myself that I'm a little reluctant to do this and I admire people who are doing this more. Honestly, I'm afraid of looking dumb, which is ridiculous. But also there's friction for me here in that we're remote and I don't really know anyone well yet. I hope to use this technique more in the classroom.
          </p>
          <p>
            <strong>Improving your process with reflection.</strong>
            <br><br>I love this and I always learn something when I spend time reflecting. This is the one skill out of this list I'd like to have as a superpower
