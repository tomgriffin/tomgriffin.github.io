        <h2>3 New things I've learned about myself and my ego.</h2>
        <article>
          <p>
            These learnings align with Growth Mindset/Fixed Mindset. The first two issues indicate Fixed Mindset thinking.
          </p>
          <p>
            <ol>
              <li>I am afraid to be wrong/look like I don't know what I'm doing. Especially in front of large groups. Foundations is a large group and I don't know anyone well yet. I found it hard to post updates about my completed work esp if I wasn't happy with the work. I was rarely happy with my work because I was timeboxing and not getting it to a state I am more comfortable sharing. Intellectually, I can reason about why it's a good idea to share work even if I'm not 100% happy with it. But in my heart, there was often some resistance there so I didn't do it at every opportunity.</li>
              <li>At times, my expectations for my own ability to solve problems quickly are too high. I can then get too quickly frustrated and subequently self-critical when I don't solve something quickly. I noticed this in Sprint 5 challenges e.g. Minesweeper and JS Carnival.</li>
              <li>I learned I can mitigate these tendancies by focussing on my process and what I'm learning in each moment, rather than on whether I get the solution right quickly/first time.</li>
            </ol>
          </p>
        </article>
        <h2>What are the role of values, empathy and self awareness in learning and programming?</h2>
        <article>
          <p>
            Honestly, I'm not sure about the importance of values in learning and programming. I don't think this is an issue for me personally. 
          </p>
          <p>
            Empathy is an important framing for all aspects of learning and programming. It's a challenging and difficult journey. It is important to realise that everyone will have different challenges and struggles at different times. But also that it is possible to get through most difficult situations with time and effort.
          </p>
          <p>
            Self-awareness and self-acceptance are very important. You need to learn to know and monitor yourself. It can be too easy to ignore your own feelings and try to push through. This borrowing-from-yourself won't work well in the long term.
          </p>
          <p>
            For me, Growth Mindset + Neural Plasticity as well as EQ are 2 concepts which have really resonated with me as I've learned about them in Foundations.
          </p>
        </article>
        <h2>What has surprised me the most about the core learning?</h2>
        <article>
          <p>
            <ol>
              <li>What it is like to Think Like a Web Developer and that you can develop and apply your own process to solving any/all problems.</li>
              <li>How NP and GM are both sides of the same coin. Your brain is always changing and you can quickly and significantly improve your ability in any area through regular practice. Since NP happens regardless of what we do, we can make the most of NP through a Growth Mindset, which is the cognitive equivalent of that physical process. Whereas a fixed mindset is unhelpful as a mindset when you encounter challenges. Plus it doesn't reflect biological realities about how the brain functions.</li>
              <li>EQ is actually more important for long term career enjoyment and success than IQ. And that EQ skills can be learned; </li>

        <article>
          <p>
            Extracting the meaning and steps to improve, that work for me, and that I can actually use to drive the changes I want.

        <h2>Why does DevAcademy spend so much time focusing on core learning in a web development bootcamp course?</h2>
        <article>
          <p>
            Reading the materials and from my own experience, a strong set of Core skills will help you be happy and successful and deal with adversity as a Developer. Beyond a certain point, everyone has technical skills and they matter less in the overall picture of success.
          </p>
        </article>
        <h2>Is time spent studying core learning a waste of time? Should we have all done more programming practice instead? </h2>
        <article>
          <p>
            Absolutely not. In fact we could spend more time on them in my opinion. Being aware of Core skills, their importance, and spending time improving them, will actually help you develop technical skills throughout your life because you'll understand how to learn, the importance of practice, working with others, how you work best, how to help yourself when you're struggling.

        <h2>Long term goal and/or career pathway?</h2>
          <article>
            <p class="italics" >
              What are you hoping to use the skills you gain during this course for? 
            </p>
            <p>
              I'd like to get a position at a company with a great culture; where I can continue to learn and grow; where I can contribute to solving a meaningful business problem; where I can experience what it takes to write quality software professionally; I want to be able to say with confidence - yes I'm a software developer. I want to be part of a high-functioning team where I can contribute as much as I learn.
            </p>
            <p class="italics" >
              What sort of impact would you like to make once you leave Dev Academy?
            </p>
            <p>
              After a few years focussing on growing my dev skills, I want to start to have a wider impact. Perhaps this means a Tech Lead role or starting up my own business.
            </p>
            <p class="italics" >
              Do you have a destination in mind?
            </p>
            <p>
              I've worked at a Saas company for the last 3.5 years so a position with a similar company is naturally what comes to mind first. One thing I'm trying to do as part of the course is try to learn what opportunities are available in the industry more broadly. I've seen some roles posted in the last 5 weeks that are really interesting e.g. the blockchain/welfare concept.

        <h2>What will be my biggest strengths and limitations in Bootcamp?</h2>
          <article>
            <p class="italics" >
              Re-evaluate your strengths and limitations from Sprint 2. 
            </p>
            <p>
              #### strengths
              <ol>
                <li> I've upskilled and adapted to the Bootcamp expectations fairly quickly. I've done well at working in small bursts aka pomodoros. I've also made a relatively large amount of progress in learning to be happy with 6-7/10 instead of trying to take work to nine-ish or higher out-of-ten.</li>
                <li>I'm good at developing new habits - if I can set up the right level of support and accountability around me. </li>
              </ol>
#### limitations
              <ol>
                <li>At the moment, I think of solutions in terms of languages like Java which are quite different to JS.  My solutions are often not as light or easily-understood as others I've seen. I worry a bit about what it might be like for team mates dealing with code I write like that.</li>
                <li>I can fall into a trap of my own making where I place too much emphasis on solving the thing quickly. A quick solve 'means' I know what I'm doing. Then when I am struggling, I start to think I'm not doing well, and won't do well. This affects my motivation, mood, reduces what I actually learn by making mistakes and I get grumpier afk.</li>
                <li>When I'm in a haste to finish work, I can also deviate from breaking work down methodically and completing it step by step. I lose patience with this process and try to just go faster. Inevitably, I have a micro-burnout where I get tired, and the work is unsatisfying because I don't know what I've actually achieved at the end of some hours of frenetic work.</li>
              </ol>
            </p>
            <p class="italics" >
              Has your idea of these changed over the course of Foundations? 
            </p>
            <p>
              Definitely. I've been doing a lot of new things in the last 5 weeks. When you try to do new things, you naturally learn how you respond to the new situation and therefore learn more about yourself.
            </p>
            <p class="italics" >
              How do you think these will help/hinder you during Bootcamp?
            </p>
            <p>
              The 3 limitations I've listed above will help me during Bootcamp because they'll give me areas to focus on and improve. Also they will act like signals. If I notice I'm suffering in these ways, I can notice it and ask for help from people.
            </p>
          </article>
        <h2>What will be my biggest non-technical challenge at Bootcamp?</h2>
          <article>
            <p class="italics" >
              Non-technical challenges might include staying on top of the material, working in groups, speaking in front of the group, or keeping focused for 9 weeks, etc.
            </p>
            <p>
              As the pressure comes on, there's a significant risk I'll start to feel out of my depth/not good enough. I'll start to get self-critical and lose motivation, and/or withdraw from interacting with the group.

              <br><br> The key for me will be to keep breaking work down into smaller actionable steps. I'll lean on my technical and core skills facilitators, and my family for help and support.
            </p>
          </article>
        <h2>Non-technical skills I most want to develop in myself at Bootcamp?</h2>
          <article>
            <p class="italics" >
              At Dev Academy we have a large focus around human skills and improving yourself. Based on your strengths/limitations, what are some areas for development you would like to work on?
            </p>
            <p>
              I want to develop a resilient attitude for myself so I can maintain a mature perspective on my challenges and difficult moments that arise during Bootcamp. I do have room to improve in the areas listed above relating to working with others, but I do have some experience in those already, so they are less of a priority for me compared to improving the way I think about and react to situations.
            </p>
          </article>
        <h2>Expectations of myself at Bootcamp.</h2>
          <article>
            <p class="italics">
              Based on your knowledge of Bootcamp, how and where will you seek help in a timely way?
            </p>
            <p>
              I expect I'll be able to get myself unstuck pretty easily while on campus, either by speaking to other students, or the teachers. Or rather there will be lots of opportunities for help available to me and it's up to me to use them.
            </p>
            <p>
              Because when I'm under pressure aiming for a deadline of some sort, I sacrifice other parts of my life ... I intend to create a weekly schedule that prioritises other parts of my life, and then fill in the gaps with BootCamp work.
