    <div id="about-me">
      <p id="about-me-text">My name is Tom Griffin and I am in Auckland. I’m looking forward to joining my Horoeka cohort in person in October :crossed_fingers:
        <br>I was going for a run last Sunday and happened to see the CEO of the company I had just resigned from on Friday. I said I had resigned to attend a Development Bootcamp and he said in a CEO-kind-of-way ‘Follow your dreams!’ I thought to myself - that’s a bit strong. I haven’t literally dreamed of doing a Development Bootcamp!
        <br>But in a CEO-kind-of-way he was right. 20 years ago I went to Auckland Uni to do computer science. I’ve since worked in the tech industry in QA roles and management roles which were awesome. But, I originally wanted to do be a Developer and that ‘dream’ never completely left me. About 6 weeks ago, I was feeling my time was coming to an end at my then-current job so I made a quick decision to resign in time to be able to start at EDA with you all on Monday.
        <br>I’m at EDA to learn some new skills and new ways of thinking. I’m at EDA because after the first COVID lockdown, I realised my family could survive challenges, and that if you don’t follow your dreams now, you might miss out. Why EDA? I really like the look of the Tech and Core components of the course, and I have a friend who went through EDA 2 years ago and loved it.
        Regarding Values and Identity - at the moment figuring out my values seems a bit out of reach for me. Thinking about and changing my identity seems more relevant and interesting to me.</p>
