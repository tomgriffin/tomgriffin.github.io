        <h1>Neuroplasticity and ... </h1>
        <h2>How understanding the principles of neuroplasticity benefits people.</h2>
        <article>
          <p>
            Understanding these principles of neuroplasticity (NP) helps people becasue it gives them a mental model for how the brain grows and changes. They can take this understanding and figure out which of their behaviours contribute or don't contribute to NP and brain growth.

              <strong>Use it or lose it.</strong>
              <br><br>Failure to drive specific brain functions can lead to loss of abilities.
            </p>  
            <p>
              <strong>Use it and improve it.</strong>
              <br><br>Training that drives a specific brain function can lead to improving abilities.
            </p>
            <p>
              <strong>Specificity.</strong>
              <br><br>The nature of the training experience dictates the nature of the change in the brain (plasticity).
            </p> 
            <p>
              <strong>Transference</strong>
              <br><br>Change in function as a result of one training experience can even lead to learning other similar skills.
            </p>
            <p>
              <strong>Interference</strong>
              <br><br>Brain changes (plasticity) that result in bad habits can interfere with learning good habits.
            </p>
            <p>
              <strong>Repetition matters.</strong>
              <br><br>Change (plasticity) requires sufficient repetition.
            </p>
            <p>
              <strong>Intensity matters.</strong>
              <br><br>Change (plasticity) requires intensive training.
            </p>
            <p>
              <strong>Time matters.</strong>
              <br><br>Different forms of change (plasticity) in the brain happen at different times during training.
            </p>
            <p>
              <strong>Salience matters.</strong>
              <br><br>The training experience must be meaningful to the person in order to cause change (plasticity).
            </p>
            <p>
              <strong>Age matters.</strong>
              <br><br>Training-induced change (plasticity) occurs more readily in younger brains.
            </p>
          </div>
          <p> 
            <br>Armed with this knowledge, people can make changes to their behaviour to leverage the principles of NP to make the best conditions for brain growth and ultimately fulfilling their potential.

        <h2>How to engage with the principles of neuroplasticity for your own benefit.</h2>
        <article>
          <p>Naturally I'm thinking of how to apply the NP ideas to the Bootcamp.
            <br><br>I will endeavour to do good, challenging, regular practice of skills I have - to keep them strong - and skills I want to develop.
            These include skills in the Tech and Core parts of the curriculum.</p>

        <h2>How to increase your neuroplasticity.</h2>
        <article>
          <p>
            Get younger :)
            <br><br>Good regular practice like Kata for coding. I'm not sure how to regularly practice some of the Core skills.
            I suspect we'll do that in the Bootcamp to extend what we've learned in foundations.

            In addition to the course materials, I found <a href="https://www.cfimove.org/10-principles-of-neuroplasticity-part-1/" a>this</a> list of NP principles useful.

        <h1> ... Growth Mindset.</h1>
        <h2>Relevance, your Honour?</h2>
        <article>
          <p>
            Growth Mindset (GM) is a person's conception of whether their abilities in a particular area are fixed, or whether they can develop their abilities over time by challenging themselves and focussing on learning.
            <br><br>The flipside of GM is Fixed Mindset (FM). With FM, a person believes their abilities in a particular area are fixed and can't be improved.
          </p>
        </article>
        <h2>Surprises, insights?</h2>
        <article>
          <p>
            I recognised a lot of FM in myself, especially in a work context and in the EDA course so far. It's easy to lose focus on learning and getting better, and to slip into habits of trying not to look bad and trying to avoid failure.
            Instances of GM didn't come to mind as easily, but I'm sure they're there. 
            <br><br> I notice I'm often GM the first few times I try something new. Then if I'm successful, I switch to FM.
            This is seems related to Dweck's experiment (which went a little something like this) she gave a group of kids a maths test. She praised half of the kids for their outcomes/being smart and praised the other half of the kids for effort or strategy rather than outcome. 
            <br><br> The first group of kids did much worse on subsequent tests, the second group of kids did better.

        <article>
          <p>
            If I'm feeling familiar feelings of resistance to starting some work, or second-guessing myself before I take an action, I'll ask myself some questions to diagnose my mindset;
            <br><br> ----> Am I trying to prove myself over and over again? <strong> Will I succeed or fail? Will I look smart or dumb? Will I be accepted or rejected? Will I feel like a winner or a loser? . . . </strong>
            <br><br> ----> If so, I'll re-focus on what I can learn from doing the particular activity. I'll do this by literally sitting, thinking and writing down a list.

            This is a great visual explanation and comparison of the two mindsets.
